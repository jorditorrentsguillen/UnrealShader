# UnrealShader

The UnrealShader for MODO 801 is a plugin which provides a physically
based material for creating assets for Unreal Engine 4. The new
surface properties are the same as in Unreal and MODO’s preview
render is a close approximation of the in-game look.

The latest kit version is always in the following location:
https://github.com/zoltan-erdokovy/UnrealShader/blob/master/Kit/UnrealShader.lpk?raw=true
Only the windows platform is guaranteed to be updated, others may lag behind.
